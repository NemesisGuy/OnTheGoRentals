# If you want to commit a template, name it e.g., application.properties.template
application.properties
application-api.properties
application-secrets.properties
mysql-db.properties
 # Ignores this file anywhere, unless un-ignored below for a specific path
/src/main/resources/old-application.properties
# If you need to commit mysql-db.properties for src/main/resources, un-ignore it:
# !src/main/resources/mysql-db.properties

### Specific Files to Ignore at Root ###
/OnTheGoRentals.drawio
# HELP.md # Typically, you want to commit this. Uncomment if you want to ignore.

### Directories to Commit ###
# Explicitly un-ignore top-level directories like 'docs' if they might be caught by other rules
# or to make their inclusion clear.
!docs/
# Add other similar directories if needed:
# !assets/
# !diagrams/

### Problematic un-ignores (Review if you really need these) ###
# The following lines un-ignore 'target' directories within src. This is NOT recommended.
# If you have specific files within these 'target' folders to commit,
# list them explicitly with a leading '!' instead of un-ignoring the whole folder.
# Example: !src/main/java/com/example/target/my-generated-file.txt
# --- Commented out for safety ---
# !**/src/main/**/target/
# !**/src/test/**/target/

# Ignore all uploaded files
/uploads/
# Specific upload directories
uploads/cars/
uploads/selfies/

# Ignore local environment files
.env
