# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are currently focused on supporting the latest stable release of OnTheGoRentals. Security updates are primarily applied to this version. 

While we aim to provide security patches for critical vulnerabilities in the immediately preceding major version for a limited time, users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest stable release to ensure they have the most secure version of the software.

For example:
*   If `2.0.x` is the latest stable release, it will receive all security updates.
*   `1.x.x` might receive critical patches for a short period after `2.0.0` is released.
*   Versions older than the preceding major version (e.g., `0.x.x` if `1.x.x` is the preceding major) are considered unsupported.

Please check our project releases or announcements for specific information on supported version timelines. Upgrading to the latest stable version is always the recommended practice for optimal security and functionality.
